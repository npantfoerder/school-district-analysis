## Overview of the School District Analysis
Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, wants help analyzing data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. Aggregating the data and showcasing trends in school performances will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the budget allotments.

The school board has notified Maria that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty. The math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders need to be replaced with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Maria also wants a report describing how these changes affected the overall analysis.
